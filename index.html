    <h2>The ICC Cricket World Cup: A Brief History</h2>
    <p><b>Origins and Inception:</b><br/>
        The concept of a Cricket World Cup was proposed by Sir Don Bradman in the 1930s.<br />
        The inaugural tournament was organized by the International Cricket Conference (now ICC) and took place in 1975.
        <br/><br/>
       
        <b>Inaugural Tournament (1975): </b><br/>
        Held in England, it featured eight teams.<br/>
        Matches were 60 overs per side with white clothing and red balls.<br/>
       The West Indies emerged as the first champions.<br/><br/>

       <b>Development and Milestones: </b><br/>
       The World Cup became a quadrennial event, with formats evolving to include more teams.<br/>
        India's 1983 win and the introduction of colored clothing in 1992 were key milestones.<br/>
         The 1996 tournament, hosted by the subcontinent, showcased cricket's passion.<br/><br/>

         <b>Continued Success:</b>
         The ICC Cricket World Cup remains a premier cricket event.<br/>
         It has contributed to the sport's global growth and the emergence of cricketing legends.<br/><br/>
         The Cricket World Cup's rich history and evolution have made it a globally celebrated sporting spectacle, shaping the future of cricket.
